Rawpy offers many demosaic algorithms, used for reading RAW formats. 
Below are the average computation times (3 repetitions) of opening 
the same 5796x3870 .CR2 image. Tests were performed on my thinkpad
t-430 (i7-3520M @ 4x 3.6GHz).

        AAHD took: 9.001 secs.
        AFD took: 2.603 secs.
        AHD took: 2.61 secs.
        AMAZE took: 2.612 secs.
        DCB took: 4.33 secs.
        DCB took: 4.333 secs.
        DHT took: 3.279 secs.
        LINEAR took: 1.946 secs.
        LMMSE took: 2.606 secs.
        MODIFIED_AHD took: 2.615 secs.
        PPG took: 1.775 secs.
        VCD took: 2.608 secs.
        VCD_MODIFIED_AHD took: 2.607 secs.
        VNG took: 5.334 secs.       

The outputs had no discernible visual differences. 
Since rawpy uses AHD as the default and AHD's rate is fairly fast. 
it was kept as the default param.
