For windows build:
	- it appears necessary to use tensorflow 1.14.*
	- it is necessary to amend the astor library, otherwise it cannot find its version file
		- easiest way is using a venv, modify the astor's __init__.py 
		- where it opens VERSION file, comment it out and just add:
			__version__ = "0.8.1"
	- run pyinstaller from virtualenv by using ./env/scripts/pyinstaller ....
